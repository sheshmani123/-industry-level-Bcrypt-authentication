# SecureAuth - Industry-Level Authentication Backend 👨‍💻🔐

SecureAuth is a robust authentication backend designed to provide industry-level security for user credentials. By utilizing bcrypt with a salt round of 10, we ensure the utmost protection against password-related vulnerabilities.

## Features 🚀

- **Bcrypt Encryption**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, making it practically impossible for attackers to reverse engineer and retrieve plain text passwords.
- **Salt Round 10**: We employ a salt round of 10 to enhance the cryptographic strength, adding an extra layer of security against brute-force attacks.
- **User-Friendly Authentication**: Users can log in by providing their email and password, and the backend seamlessly validates credentials with the securely stored bcrypt strings.
- **Database Security**: All password data is stored in a secure database, safeguarding user information from potential threats.
